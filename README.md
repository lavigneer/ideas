# ideas
A place to write down my project ideas

- [ ] A neovim plugin that opens a prompt to search for documentation related to the current file type. E.g., In a rust file, I can somehow query for a stdlib function and have it open a browser window with those docs open. This could also be a cli that could be integrated into neovim so it's more portable to other tools
- [ ] A tool that will generate a graph of relationships between types in GO libraries. E.g., the kubernetes library has a very large set of types, being able to see a visual breakdown of those relationships would be helpful in navigating things
- [ ] A Kubernetes topology visualizer
- [ ] A "go-blueprint" style generator for a kubernetes setup for devops
